This product we have here is Notes Sharing System, revision number being 1.0. It is a web application which provides online notes sharing services to everyone at their doorstep. The students in the college can connect through internet to get this service. This web application is more effective, quick in providing notes especially, to students who find it difficult to maintain the bulk of notes throughout the semester. This helps the students to maintain a proper record of notes which they can download and can even upload the notes on their own.

Notes Sharing System is based on an innovative idea which aims to ease the hectic task of maintaining the bulk of notes. Especially for college students like us who face sleepless nights before exam just to have a grasp of topics covered. The open collaboration repository of notes provided will sort out this problem faced by students.
